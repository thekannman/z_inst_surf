# z_inst_surf
This program allows calculation of instantaneous liquid interfaces based on the work of Willard and Chandler (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2010, 114 (5), pp 1954â€“1958)

THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED!!!

Required libraries:
* GROMACS XTC library for reading position/velocity files. 
    http://www.gromacs.org/Developer_Zone/Programming_Guide/XTC_Library
* The Armadillo library for matrix calculations.
    http://arma.sourceforge.net/
* The Boost libraries for input option parsing, 4D tensor calculations, lexical casting, and output formatting.
    http://www.boost.org/


This program is still in the testing phase, and updates will be forthcoming. The current status is:
* The surface calculations seem to work.
* The average, deviation correlation, and density/temperature profiles are still being tested.
* Only GROMACS input is accepted, with positions in a .xtc file and velocities in a .trr file.
* Convolution parameters are hard-coded to match those in the Willard/Chandler paper.
